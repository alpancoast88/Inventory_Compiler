# Inventory_Compiler
Compile plot data into attribute table format 

This is an early attempt at compiling forest inventory data from plot records to a stand level summary table format. 

The population of interest is a large forest tract, stratified into 'stands'. Samples are taken within each strata. Variables of interest are summarized for each strata.  

Standing timber volume estimates are inclulded, however a better approach is implemented in a seperate compliler dealing with volume estimates and merchandising. Results from both compilers are combined to provide complete summary. 

Eventually everything will be intergrated into a single tool
